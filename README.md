# Master Thesis: Optimizing Graph Neural Networks for Predicting Fertility Intentions in Social Networks

## Overview
This repository contains the Python implementation and associated documentation for the Master's thesis project titled "Optimizing Graph Neural Networks for Predicting Fertility Intentions in Social Networks" by Dimitrios Diamantidis. This project was developed as part of the Applied Data Science Master's program at Utrecht University. It explores the application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model and predict fertility intentions within social networks, incorporating complex social and individual data.

## Inspiration
This project draws significant inspiration from the research conducted by Stulp et al. (2023), which examines the influence of individual traits and social network structures on fertility decisions. By leveraging advanced computational methods, this thesis extends their work to better predict and understand the dynamic interplay of social influences on fertility intentions.

## Data
The dataset used in this project reflects methodologies similar to those employed by Stulp et al. (2023), focusing on personal and egocentric network data. The repository includes detailed preprocessing steps tailored to optimize data for GNN analysis, highlighting features that significantly impact fertility decisions.

## Python Scripts
The `Python_script.py` file provided here encompasses all the code utilized for data preprocessing, model construction, training, and evaluation. Each section of the code is thoroughly documented to clarify its functionality and purpose.
